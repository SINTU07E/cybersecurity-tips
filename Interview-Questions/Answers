  - File type validation, directory traversal, malware upload.

- **Use of HSTS and CSP headers?**  
  - HSTS: Enforces HTTPS.  
  - CSP: Prevents XSS by restricting script sources.

- **Hashing vs Encryption vs Encoding?**  
  - Hashing: One-way, irreversible (MD5, SHA).  
  - Encryption: Reversible with a key (AES, RSA).  
  - Encoding: Data transformation (Base64).

- **Asymmetric vs Symmetric Encryption?**  
  - Symmetric: Single key (AES, DES).  
  - Asymmetric: Public-private key pair (RSA, ECC).

### **Thin/Thick Client**
- **SCA (Software Composition Analysis)?**  
  - Identifies vulnerabilities in third-party libraries and dependencies.

- **Difference between Thick and Thin Client?**  
  - **Thick:** Local processing, less network dependency.  
  - **Thin:** Cloud-based, relies on server-side processing.

---

### **Networking**
- **What is port 88 and how to exploit it?**  
  - Used by Kerberos for authentication, can be targeted for ticket forgery.

- **How to convert subnet to IP?**  
  - Calculate network address using subnet mask.

- **What is Host Discovery Scan?**  
  - Identifies live hosts in a network (e.g., Nmap -sn).

- **How to exploit FTP?**  
  - Anonymous login, brute-force, misconfigured permissions.

- **Procedure for Network VAPT?**  
  - Recon → Scanning → Exploitation → Post-exploitation → Reporting.
