## **Android Security**  
1. **How does Frida help in mobile pentesting?**  
   - Frida is a dynamic instrumentation tool that helps modify app behavior at runtime, bypassing security controls like SSL pinning and root detection.  

2. **What is Dex2Jar used for?**  
   - It converts Androidâ€™s DEX files into JAR files to decompile and analyze the appâ€™s bytecode.  

3. **How do you test API security in an Android app?**  
   - Capture requests via Burp Suite, check for authentication flaws, test for IDOR, and replay requests with modified data.  

4. **How does Insecure Logging pose a security risk?**  
   - If sensitive data is logged, it can be extracted from logs, leading to data exposure.  

5. **What are the risks of improperly configured Content Providers?**  
   - If not protected, they can allow unauthorized access to app data via SQL injection or unauthorized queries.

## **Web Application Security**  
1. **What is HTTP Request Smuggling?**  
   - A vulnerability that allows an attacker to send a specially crafted request to manipulate how a backend processes multiple HTTP requests.  

2. **What is a Null Byte Injection Attack?**  
   - A technique used to bypass input validation by inserting `%00` to terminate strings early.  

3. **How do you exploit Host Header Injection?**  
   - Modify the `Host` header in an HTTP request to hijack password reset links or perform SSRF attacks.  

4. **What are common GraphQL security issues?**  
   - Over-fetching sensitive data, improper rate limiting, lack of access control, and DoS via deep queries.  

5. **How do you check for an insecure CORS configuration?**  
   - Look for `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *` or permissive wildcard origins that allow unauthorized access.

## **Thick/Thin Client Security**  
1. **How to analyze traffic of a Thick Client application?**  
   - Use tools like Burp Suite or Fiddler with proxy settings to intercept and analyze requests.  

2. **What are common Thick Client vulnerabilities?**  
   - Hardcoded credentials, insecure storage, weak encryption, DLL hijacking.  

3. **How do you bypass certificate pinning in a Thick Client?**  
   - Use tools like Frida, mitmproxy, or recompile the app after removing the pinning logic.

## **Networking & Infra Security**  
1. **What is ARP Spoofing?**  
   - Manipulating the ARP cache to redirect network traffic to an attackerâ€™s machine.  

2. **How do you check for SMB vulnerabilities?**  
   - Use `nmap -p 445 --script smb-vuln-* <target>` to detect SMB-related exploits.  

3. **How does ICMP-based network scanning work?**  
   - It sends ICMP echo requests (ping) to discover active hosts in a network.  

4. **What is MITM (Man-in-the-Middle) Attack?**  
   - Intercepting and altering communication between two parties without their knowledge.

## **General Pentesting Questions**  
1. **How do you handle rate limits in a pentest?**  
   - Rotate IPs, use sleep intervals, and try low-profile attacks to evade detection.  

2. **How do you perform a Subdomain Enumeration?**  
   - Use tools like Sublist3r, Amass, and crt.sh to discover subdomains.  

3. **What is a WAF and how do you bypass it?**  
   - A Web Application Firewall filters HTTP traffic; bypass using encoding, case variation, or headers manipulation.  

4. **How do you detect a vulnerable JWT token?**  
   - Check for weak signing algorithms like `none`, leaked secrets, or insecure claims.

## **Red Teaming & Exploitation**  
1. **How do you escalate privileges in Windows?**  
   - Exploit weak ACLs, unquoted service paths, DLL hijacking, or use token impersonation.  

2. **What is LSASS Dumping?**  
   - Extracting credentials from LSASS memory using tools like Mimikatz or procdump.  

3. **How do you bypass AMSI (Antimalware Scan Interface)?**  
   - Use obfuscated payloads, AMSI patching, or reflective DLL injection.
