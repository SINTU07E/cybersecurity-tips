### **ðŸ”¹ Web Application Security**  
1. **How can you detect and exploit template injection vulnerabilities?**  
   â†’ Identify **user-controlled template syntax** in **Jinja2, Twig, or Freemarker** and execute payloads like `{{7*7}}`. If it evaluates to `49`, itâ€™s vulnerable.  

2. **What are some real-world attack scenarios for HTTP request smuggling?**  
   â†’ Attackers manipulate **Content-Length** and **Transfer-Encoding** headers to poison caches, bypass security filters, or hijack sessions.  

3. **How do you bypass client-side JavaScript validation for security testing?**  
   â†’ Use **Burp Suite or Tamper Data** to modify requests before they reach the server, bypassing frontend security.  

4. **Explain the risks of allowing wildcard CORS configurations (`Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *`).**  
   â†’ Any website can make requests to the vulnerable API, leading to **data theft and CSRF-like attacks**.  

5. **What is a JWT attack, and how can you exploit it?**  
   â†’ Attackers exploit weak JWT configurations, such as **none algorithm abuse, key leakage, or brute-forcing weak secrets**.  


ðŸ”¹ Android Security
6. How do you analyze an Android APK without running it on a device?
â†’ Use static analysis with tools like MobSF, JADX, and APKTool to inspect code, permissions, and configurations.

7. What are the security risks of using deep links in Android apps?
â†’ Unvalidated deep links can lead to intent hijacking, open redirects, and data leakage if improperly handled.

8. How do you bypass SSL pinning in an Android application?
â†’ Use Frida, Objection, or Xposed to hook SSL functions and bypass certificate validation.

9. What is the role of the KeyStore in Android security?
â†’ The Android Keystore stores cryptographic keys securely, preventing them from being extracted from the device.

10. Explain the impact of exported ContentProvider vulnerabilities.
â†’ Improperly exported ContentProviders can lead to **data theft, SQL injection,Privilege Escalation, Data theft via URI Injection,etc.
If android:exported="true" is set without proper security controls, it can be dangerous and should be false unless explicitly required.
Set android:exported="false" unless the component needs to be accessed by other apps, in which case proper permissions and security checks must be implemented.

### **ðŸ”¹ Network Security**  
11. **How do you perform MITM (Man-in-the-Middle) attacks using ARP spoofing?**  
   â†’ Use `arpspoof` or `ettercap` to manipulate ARP tables and intercept network traffic.  

12. **What is DNS rebinding, and how can it be abused?**  
   â†’ DNS rebinding tricks a victimâ€™s browser into bypassing **Same-Origin Policy** to access internal services.  

13. **How do you detect out-of-band (OOB) vulnerabilities in a pentest?**  
   â†’ Use **Burp Collaborator, interact.sh, or DNS exfiltration** to capture blind SSRF, XXE, or command injection callbacks.  

14. **How would you enumerate SMB shares in a corporate network?**  
   â†’ Use `smbclient -L <IP>` or `enum4linux` to list accessible shares and potential misconfigurations.  

15. **What are the risks of LLMNR/NBT-NS poisoning, and how do you prevent them?**  
   â†’ Attackers use **Responder** to capture NTLM hashes. Mitigate by **disabling LLMNR/NBT-NS** and enforcing SMB signing.  

---

### **ðŸ”¹ Cryptography & Secure Coding**  
16. **How would you exploit a weak JWT signing algorithm?**  
   â†’ If **`none` algorithm** is allowed, modify the JWT header to `"alg": "none"` and remove the signature to bypass authentication.  

17. **Why is ECB mode in encryption considered insecure?**  
   â†’ ECB (Electronic Codebook) **does not use an IV**, causing identical plaintext blocks to encrypt to identical ciphertext blocks, exposing patterns.  

18. **What is a padding oracle attack, and how does it work?**  
   â†’ Attackers use error messages from padding validation to decrypt AES-CBC encrypted data without knowing the key.  

19. **How can an attacker exploit weak password hashing techniques?**  
   â†’ Weak hashes like **MD5 or SHA1** can be brute-forced or cracked using **rainbow tables**.  

20. **What is the difference between nonce reuse attacks and IV reuse attacks?**  
   â†’ **Nonce reuse** (in AES-GCM) leads to ciphertext collisions; **IV reuse** (in AES-CBC) allows padding oracle attacks.

### **ðŸ”¹ Advanced Penetration Testing**  
21. **How do you escalate privileges in a Windows environment after gaining a foothold?**  
   â†’ Use **token impersonation, DLL hijacking, or exploiting unquoted service paths**.  

22. **What are some techniques for bypassing endpoint detection & response (EDR)?**  
   â†’ Use **process injection, direct syscalls, AMSI bypass, or obfuscation techniques**.  

23. **How do you analyze malware behavior in a sandbox environment?**  
   â†’ Use **Cuckoo Sandbox, Procmon, and Wireshark** to monitor process creation, registry changes, and network traffic.  

24. **What is Ghostwriting in phishing campaigns?**  
   â†’ Creating **realistic but fake email threads** to manipulate victims into trusting and opening malicious content.  

25. **How do attackers exploit OAuth misconfigurations in web applications?**  
   â†’ **Stealing access tokens, redirect URI manipulation, or token leakage via referrer headers.**  

---

### **ðŸ”¹ Red Teaming & Exploit Development**  
26. **How do you create a custom payload for a red team engagement?**  
   â†’ Use **MSFVenom, Cobalt Strike Beacon, or custom C2 frameworks** with obfuscation to evade detection.  

27. **What is Heap Spraying, and how is it used in exploit development?**  
   â†’ Pre-filling the heap with **predictable data** to increase the chances of controlling memory corruption exploits.  

28. **How would you evade Windows Defender & AMSI while executing payloads?**  
   â†’ Use **direct syscalls, encrypted loaders, or AMSI bypass techniques like patching AMSI.dll**.  

29. **What are DACL misconfigurations, and how can they be exploited in privilege escalation?**  
   â†’ Weak **Discretionary Access Control Lists (DACLs)** allow attackers to modify files/services they shouldnâ€™t have access to.  

30. **How do you perform cloud penetration testing (AWS/Azure/GCP)?**  
   â†’ Enumerate misconfigured **IAM roles, public S3 buckets, exposed APIs, and privilege escalation paths**.
