Android: 

What are Android, key components? 

=In Android, key components to inspect during APK pentesting are:

Activities – Entry points for user interaction; check for exported activities.
Services – Background processes; review for insecure IPC (Inter-Process Communication).
Broadcast Receivers – Listen for system or app events; check for unauthorized triggers.
Content Providers – Manage data sharing; test for SQL injection and unauthorized access.
Intents – Used for communication between components; ensure proper input validation.


What is android:exported="true"? 

= If android:exported="true" is set in the AndroidManifest.xml, it means the component can be accessed by other apps.


Infra: 
How will you approach if we give you a IP?
Which tools you will use?

What is Thread Modeling 
What is SSTI (Server-Side Template Injection)
Which is vulnerable hash - MD5, SHA1
What is active directory 
What is VLAN
What is ssl pinning

Symmetric Encryption Examples: AES, DES, 3DES, Blowfish.
Asymmetric Encryption Examples: RSA, ECC, DSA, ElGamal.
